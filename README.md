shengji-client
---
This is the front-end corresponding to the [shengji](http://github.com/joshcai/shengji) game.

To serve the client, enter:

```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

or any other HTTP server. Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/client.html` from any browser that supports WebSockets (pretty much all modern browsers).
